Website for SWE Hacks (4/24/21)

I'm sure all UW students can relate to having super full email inboxes,
so I thought I would make a website that has a compilation of all the
resources that UW has notified us about regarding race-related issues.
The sweet and simple UI of my website takes inspiration from ______ and ______.
The difference is that I wanted to challenge myself to build this website
from scratch instead of using pre-made templates on website-building platforms.
I used HTML and CSS to make the website and had a super fun learning experience!
