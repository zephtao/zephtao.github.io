SWE Hacks 2021

I built my website, Engage Page, from scratch using HTML and CSS. It is inspired by https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/ and
https://anti-asianviolenceresources.carrd.co/, but I wanted to take on the challenge of coding it myself rather than using
provided website templates on platforms like Carrd. The premise of Engage Page is simple: it contains a compilation of
resources — many of which are specifically for UW students — about race-related issues in society today. Each link opens
in a new tab. This was the first website I built from scratch, and it was a rewarding learning experience!
